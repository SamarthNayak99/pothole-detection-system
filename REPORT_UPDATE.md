# 📧 TECHNICAL REPORT UPDATED

I have updated the **Technical Deep Dive** to include a detailed section on the **Email Alert System**.

### **What's Added:**
1.  **"The Notifier" Section:** Dedicated explanation of how the system talks to Gmail.
2.  **Pin-to-Pin Breakdown:** 
    -   **Trigger:** How detection initiates the email.
    -   **Content:** Breakdown of the HTML email body (ID, Time, Action Button).
    -   **Attachment:** How the AI-annotated image is attached.
    -   **Tech:** SMTP protocol and environment variable security.

The document `TECHNICAL_DEEP_DIVE.md` now fully reflects this critical feature! 🚀
